## Create a Document

Lucidchart provides various types of documents such as whiteboards, diagrams, mind maps, etc. In the CST program, we will only need to use the diagram option.

1. After you create your account, you will see a question page to set up your recommended templates.

    **Click** [Students] → [Higher Education] → [Start diagramming].

    Recommended templates will be generated.

2. **Click** [Start diagramming] in the pop-up window.

    This will bring you to a blank diagram.

## Share a Document

Lucidchart allows you to share documents with your classmates, so you can work on the same document at the same time.

1. To share the document with others, **open** your document and **click** [Share] on the top right.

2. There are three ways to share your document. We will introduce the two common options.

### Option 1: Sharing via email

1. **Enter** the email address or Lucid group that you want to share your document with in the text box, press **return**, and the email address will appear as a gray label inside the box.

2. You can **remove** an email address by **clicking** the [x] on the side.

3. After you add all the email addresses you want, **click** [Invite].

### Option 2: Sharing via a shareable link

1. **Click** on the [Link] tab.

2. The shareable link is disabled by default, so you need to **click** on [Off] to enable it, and then **click** [Copy link].

    You now have the link address in your clipboard, and you can share your link with people or your group.

### Permissions

You can set users' permission of the document you share and individual user's permission.

    Details of each option are written inside.
