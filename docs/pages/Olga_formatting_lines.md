# Overview (Lines)
The line is the most common element of any Lucidchart diagram. We aim to make working with lines easy
and intuitive for a student. There are various tools to create and modify lines
and the guide provides information on how students can create and change lines.

# Add a regular line to your document
There are three ways a student can add a regular line.

## Add a line from a shapes menu
1. Choose the Standard shapes set by clicking the arrow on the left
side of the "Standard" set name. You will see a list of all shapes available for the selected set.
!!! warning
If you don't have any shapes set in the Shapes menu. [Check 'Add a shape library' section.](/Olga_formatting_shapes.md/#add_shape)

2. Click an arrow icon and drag the element onto the canvas.

    Now a line is displayed on your canvas.

# Add a line from an existing shape on the canvas
1. Place your cursor over any existing shape on the canvas.

You will see red circles that will appear on the border of the shape.
2. Click any red circle.
3. Drag your cursor from the shape.

# Add a line directly from a canvas
1. Click the right mouse button on any blank spot on the canvas to see a menu
2. Select the draw the line option from the menu and move your cursor to start drawing a line
3. Move the cursor to draw the line and release a mouse button to create a line on a blank canvas or drag it to any existing object to create a connection line.

# Add a smart line to your document
A smart line automatically changes its path between two objects on a diagram in the most efficient way.
1. Drag a line from one existing object on the canvas to another
2. When a cursor reaches the second object, red dots will appear on the object's borders.
3. Drag a cursor to any red dot and release the cursor to save changes.

Lucidchart provides various options on how you can customize an existing line. To start any customization, select a line on the canvas and go to the formatting toolbar to choose a desired formatting option.
