# Overview

The line is the most common element of any Lucidchart diagram. We aim to make working with lines easy
and intuitive for a student. There are various tools to create and modify lines
and the guide provides information on how students can create and modify lines.

# Add a regular line to your document

There are three ways a student can add a regular line.

side of the "Standard" set name. You will see a list of all shapes available for the selected set.

A smart line automatically changes its path between two shapes on a diagram in the most efficient way.
