| Accidentally deleted all the shapes, and need to get the default shapes back. | Shapes were deleted from the Shape menu. | Click the [+ Shape Library] menu, select "Flowchart”, “Shapes” and “Standard". |
| Need a bigger canvas because running out of space. | The canvas is too small for the content being added. | Simply drag any element on the canvas, and the canvas will automatically expand to accommodate the new space. |
| Receiving a warning message about having a limit on diagrams/documents. | The user did not register with a myBCIT email address. | Register a new account with your myBCIT email. |

| Unable to move multiple shapes together to stack them on top of each other. | The shapes are not grouped together. | Use the group function. Select all the shapes you want to group, and press “command + G”. |
| Unable to edit a shape. | The shape is locked. | Right-click on the shape, and check if it is locked. If so, unlock the shape to edit it. |
