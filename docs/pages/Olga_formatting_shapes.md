# Overview

Lucidchart provides various tools to create and modify shapes
while creating diagrams from scratch. This guide provides
information on several methods on how to deal with shapes.
Starting from the basics of shapes and providing some advanced tips and tricks.

# Add a shape to your document

1. Choose a shape set by **clicking** on the [arrow] on the left
side of the set name.
You will see a list of shapes available for the selected set.

!!!warning
    In case(If?) you can't find the desired shape in the list, you can choose another
    predefined library or create a custom one.
    [Check the 'Add a shape library' section for more details.](#add_shape)

    [Create a custom shape library](#create_shape_library)
comment TODO: this sounds more like a Note instead of warning to me.

2. **Drag** the desired shape from the list and **drop** it onto the canvas.

    The shape will appear on the canvas and is ready for further action.

comment TODO: this picture is broken. Also, do you think "Navigate" is an bolded action?

## Set default style

To change the default style for all shapes in your project:

1. **Click** anywhere on the canvas to unselect any selected shape.
2. Set style settings, such as fill color, line style, etc.

## Manage shapes layout

Lucidchart provides great flexibility in managing the layout of the diagram.

## Align

To align shapes

1. **Select** shapes you want to align by **holding** [Ctrl] while **clicking** on the shapes
or by **dragging** a box around shapes by **pressing** the left mouse button.
2. **Right-click** the mouse on the selection
3. **Choose** the Align option from the options menu
4. **Select** the alignment option from the list

comment TODO: do you need to explain what drag is? The word drag is already used earlier in selecting shapes.

## Group

You can combine several shapes into one object

or by **dragging** a box around shapes by **pressing** the left mouse button.
2. **Right-click** the mouse on the selection

comment TODO: do we need a gif here? also is "selection" a button that should have []?

## Lock

You can lock the position, size, or style of a shape

1. **Click** on shapes you want to lock.
2. **Click** on the [lock icon] on the formatting bar.
3. In the window, **check** the boxes for all characteristics of a shape you want to lock.

!!!warning
    If the shape you locked is inside a parent object, such as a container or a group,
    the shape will follow the container/group even if its position is locked.
